        <ol>
            <li class="one">
                <h3>DS</h3>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The original <i>Nintendo DS,</i> released in 2004, was revolutionary in the gaming console industry.
                    Standing for both "Developer's System" and "Dual-Screen",
                    the <i>DS</i> was loaded with new technology. It was one of the first systems to popularize the use
                    of built-in folding dual screen, including a lower touch scree and microphone.
                    In addition, it included wireless communication technology, allowing players to connect to one
                    another without using a cable or connecting to the same wireless network. The
                    system even included technology that supported Nintendo's older system, the GameBoy. Nintendo
                    planned to release its <i>Nintendo DS</i> near the same time as Sony was
                    planning to release their "PlayStation Portable", or "PSP". Sony was a huge competitor for Nintendo.
                    Their PlayStation 2 was highly successful, and is now the
                    best-selling game console of all time. Nintendo's GameCube did not have this success, so many gamers
                    suspected that the PSP would prevail over the <i>DS.</i> Players
                    mocked Nintendo's plans, especially when Nintendo announced that their device would have a
                    dual-screen system; they edited images of video game systems to have absurd
                    numbers of screens. Despite this mocking, the release of the <i>Nintendo DS</i> was proven one of
                    the most monumental system releases of all times. The dual-screen
                    design appealed to all players, ranging from those young, to those casual, and even to those
                    advanced and devoted. As well, the <i>Nintendo DS</i> was fairly affordable.
                    It originally sold for $150, and less than a year after its release, the price dropped to $130,
                    making it even more accessible to the public than it was before.</li>

                <h3>DS Lite</h3>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The <i>Nintendo DS Lite</i> was an update to the original Nintendo DS. While the function of most of
                    the hardware and software remained the same, the general look
                    and design of the device was changed to be more appealing. Although it was not a major upgrade, it
                    was still highly successful: the <i>DS Lite</i> is now Nintendo's
                    best-selling device of all time, and in addition, it is the best-selling handheld video game system
                    overall. This device retained the dual-screen and dual-cartridge
                    system seen in the original DS: foldable, an upper screen, a lower touch screen, a back slot for DS
                    cartridges, and a front slot for GameBoy cartridges. The <i>DS Lite</i> was more conveniently sized
                    than the original DS. Its redesign slimmed and lightened the console, changing the weight from 275
                    grams to 218 grams--20% lighter. The console's size was reduced as well, with the dimensions
                    changing from 5.85"/3.33"/1.14" down to 5.20"/2.91"/0.85". This means that its size was reduced by
                    0.65"/0.42"/0.29". Therefore, the console became more portable, fitting in almost any pocket size.
                    Even though this upgrade was fairly minor, the <i>DS Lite</i> was in high demand even before its
                    release. In fact, due to this demand, the device was released on March 2nd, 2006, more than a month
                    earlier than it was planned to be released. At launch, the console sold for $130, the same amount
                    that the original DS sold for after its price cut. By 2011, the <i>DS Lite</i> costed only $100.

                <h3>DSi</h3>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The <i>DSi</i> was once again a mainly design-based upgrade to the DS Lite. In the time of this 
                console's development, smartphones were being popularized. Phones' screens were getting larger, so 
                Nintendo planned to increase the screen sizes on its new DS model--and the color display of the screens 
                was improved. The entire device's length & width dimensions were just larger than the DS lite, with a 
                width of 5.39" and a length of 2.95". However, it was slimmed to a height of 0.74". In order to slim 
                the console, though, the GameBoy cardridge slot was removed. This caused some negative reception from 
                critics, but overall, the <i>DSi</i> was received very well. It included loads of new features to make 
                up for its loss of GameBoy compatibility. The <i>DSi</i> was the first DS model to include now-common 
                software, such as internet browser access, an electronic shop, downloadable games, and more! It also 
                included hardware updates, including two cameras (rear-facing and front-facing) and an SD card port 
                for additional storage space. It was released worldwide in 2009, three years after the DS Lite. The 
                <i>DSi</i> costed $170 when it came out, but the price was dropped to $150 just a few months later. 
                The <i>DSi</i> had a counterpart called the Nintendo DSi XL. It included the same software and hardware 
                with an increased size, and therefore, the screen size was larger and more user-friendly. It lauched 
                for $190 and was cut to $170 at the same time the original <i>DSi</i>'s price was reduced.</li>

                <h3>3DS</h3>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>In 2010, Nintendo announced its new DS model: the <i>Nintendo 3DS.</i> This new device supported 
                backwards compatibility with games designed for its precedents in the DS family, and was the first DS 
                console to introduce a different cartridge design in order for its games to be <i>3DS</i> exclusive. 
                Hence its name, the <i>3DS</i>'s most iconic new feature was its ability to play games with a 3D display 
                by forming a slight offset in the top-screen's visuals, causing an illusion of depth. The console 
                included a new slider bar that allowed the user to adjust the depth of the display's 3D-effect 
                offset. In addition, the <i>3DS</i> included an "AR camera" which, using the front camera, would seem to 
                add animations into your surroundings on screen. This DS console also introduced another significant 
                new hardware feature: the circle pad. This pad acts similar to a joystick and allowed for a smoother 
                control of game characters, which was greatly helpful for moving a 3D character. This added control 
                allowed the <i>3DS</i> to be targeted towards more hardcore gamers. Nintendo released heavier games, 
                such as "Final Fantasy", "Resident Evil", "Assassins Creed", and many more for this audience. The 
                <i>3DS</i> was received very well when it lauched in 2011, despite its more expensive cost of $250. 
                However, the cost did stunt its sales. For that reason, Nintendo dramatically reduced the price to $170 
                just months later. As well, much like the DSi, the <i>3DS</i> had an upsized counterpart called the 
                <i>3DS XL</i>. This version of the <i>3DS</i> released in 2012, costing $200 and including a 90% larger 
                screen size.</li>

                <h3>New 3DS</h3>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>In late 2014 to early 2015, Nintendo released its <i>New Nintendo 3DS & New 3DS XL.</i> This system was very 
                similar to the original 3DS. The upgrade was mainly hardware-based, and included better storage, improved 
                processing, and, according to the experience of some consumers, longer battery life. Its main additions 
                were two new buttons on the top left and right corners and a C-stick. The C-stick added was finicky and 
                uncomfortably rigid, making it somewhat difficult to control. Moreover, the game cartridge slot was moved 
                from the back of the console to the front, and the normal-sized SD port included in the DSi and 3DS 
                was replaced for a micro-SD card slot. The new buttons allowed for more games to be developed exclusively 
                for the <i>New Nintendo 3DS.</i> Most audiences agree that, even if you own the original 3DS, the <i>New 
                3DS</i> is worth the $200 investment. To enhance that, the system will allow you to transfer all your data, 
                even including layout, from your original 3DS to your <i>New 3DS</i>. One major criticism the new design 
                received did not concern the new update at all, but rather a major flaw in Nintendo's packaging for this 
                console: it did not come with a charging cable. While this was not an issue for most buyers, because the 
                charger required was the same charger as the DSi, 3DS, and 3DS XL's, the lack of including a charger with 
                the device was extremely problematic for those who had not previously owned a DS, those who were gifted the 
                console, those who have lost their chargers, and more. Charging cables costed $6-$12 when bought separately. 
                The failure to include this critical accessory disheartened many gamers. Nevertheless, the <i>New Nintendo 
                3DS</i> was mainly a success.</li>
                <li>The <i>New Nintendo 3DS XL</i> was the last release in the DS family, and has since been discontinued.</li>
