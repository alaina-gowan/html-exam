                <li>In 2010, Nintendo announced its new DS model: the <i>Nintendo 3DS.</i> This new device supported 
                backwards compatibility with games designed for its precedents in the DS family, and was the first DS 
                console to introduce a different cartridge design in order for its games to be <i>3DS</i> exclusive. 
                Hence its name, the <i>3DS</i>'s most iconic new feature was its ability to play games with a 3D display 
                by forming a slight offset in the top-screen's visuals, causing an illusion of depth. The console 
                included a new slider bar that allowed the user to adjust the depth of the display's 3D-effect 
                offset. In addition, the <i>3DS</i> included an "AR camera" which, using the front camera, would seem to 
                add animations into your surroundings on screen. This DS console also introduced another significant 
                new hardware feature: the circle pad. This pad acts similar to a joystick and allowed for a smoother 
                control of game characters, which was greatly helpful for moving a 3D character. This added control 
                allowed the <i>3DS</i> to be targeted towards more hardcore gamers. Nintendo released heavier games, 
                such as "Final Fantasy", "Resident Evil", "Assassins Creed", and many more for this audience. The 
                <i>3DS</i> was received very well when it lauched in 2011, despite its more expensive cost of $250. 
                However, the cost did stunt its sales. For that reason, Nintendo dramatically reduced the price to $170 
                just months later. As well, much like the DSi, the <i>3DS</i> had an upsized counterpart called the 
                <i>3DS XL</i>. This version of the <i>3DS</i> released in 2012, costing $200 and including a 90% larger 
                screen size.</li>
