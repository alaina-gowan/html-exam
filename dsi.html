                <h3>DSi</h3>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The <i>DSi</i> was once again a mainly design-based upgrade to the DS Lite. In the time of this
                    console's development, smartphones were being popularized. Phones' screens were getting larger, so
                    Nintendo planned to increase the screen sizes on its new DS model--and the color display of the
                    screens was improved. The entire device's length & width dimensions were just larger than the DS
                    lite, with a width of 5.39" and a length of 2.95". However, it was slimmed to a height of 0.74". In
                    order to slim the console, though, the GameBoy cardridge slot was removed. This caused some negative
                    reception from critics, but overall, the <i>DSi</i> was received very well. It included loads of new
                    features to make up for its loss of GameBoy compatibility. The <i>DSi</i> was the first DS model to
                    include now-common software, such as internet browser access, an electronic shop, downloadable
                    games, and more! It also included hardware updates, including two cameras (rear-facing and
                    front-facing) and an SD card port for additional storage space. It was released worldwide in 2009,
                    three years after the DS Lite. The <i>DSi</i> costed $170 when it came out, but the price was
                    dropped to $150 just a few months later. The <i>DSi</i> had a counterpart called the Nintendo DSi
                    XL. It included the same software and hardware with an increased size, and therefore, the screen
                    size was larger and more user-friendly. It lauched for $190 and was cut to $170 at the same time the
                    original <i>DSi</i>'s price was reduced.</li>
