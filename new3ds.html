            <ul>
                <li>In late 2014 to early 2015, Nintendo released its <i>New Nintendo 3DS & New 3DS XL.</i> This system
                    was very similar to the original 3DS. The upgrade was mainly hardware-based, and included better
                    storage, improved processing, and, according to the experience of some consumers, longer battery
                    life. Its main additions were two new buttons on the top left and right corners and a C-stick. The
                    C-stick added was finicky and uncomfortably rigid, making it somewhat difficult to control.
                    Moreover, the game cartridge slot was moved from the back of the console to the front, and the
                    normal-sized SD port included in the DSi and 3DS was replaced for a micro-SD card slot. The new
                    buttons allowed for more games to be developed exclusively for the <i>New Nintendo 3DS.</i> Most
                    audiences agree that, even if you own the original 3DS, the <i>New 3DS</i> is worth the $200
                    investment. To enhance that, the system will allow you to transfer all your data, even including
                    layout, from your original 3DS to your <i>New 3DS</i>. One major criticism the new design received
                    did not concern the new update at all, but rather a major flaw in Nintendo's packaging for this
                    console: it did not come with a charging cable. While this was not an issue for most buyers, because
                    the charger required was the same charger as the DSi, 3DS, and 3DS XL's, the lack of including a
                    charger with the device was extremely problematic for those who had not previously owned a DS, those
                    who were gifted the console, those who have lost their chargers, and more. Charging cables costed
                    $6-$12 when bought separately. The failure to include this critical accessory disheartened many
                    gamers. Nevertheless, the <i>New Nintendo 3DS</i> was mainly a success.</li>
                <li>The <i>New Nintendo 3DS XL</i> was the last release in the DS family, and has since been
                    discontinued.</li>
