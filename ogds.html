                <li>The original <i>Nintendo DS,</i> released in 2004, was revolutionary in the gaming console industry.
                    Standing for both "Developer's System" and "Dual-Screen", the <i>DS</i> was loaded with new
                    technology. It was one of the first systems to popularize the use of built-in folding dual screen,
                    including a lower touch screen and microphone. In addition, it included wireless communication
                    technology, allowing players to connect to one another without using a cable or connecting to the
                    same wireless network. The system even included technology that supported Nintendo's older system,
                    the GameBoy. Nintendo planned to release its <i>Nintendo DS</i> near the same time as Sony was
                    planning to release their "PlayStation Portable", or "PSP". Sony was a huge competitor for Nintendo.
                    Their PlayStation 2 was highly successful, and is now the best-selling game console of all time.
                    Nintendo's GameCube did not have this success, so many gamers suspected that the PSP would prevail
                    over the <i>DS.</i> Players mocked Nintendo's plans, especially when Nintendo announced that their
                    device would have a dual-screen system; they edited images of video game systems to have absurd
                    numbers of screens. Despite this mocking, the release of the <i>Nintendo DS</i> was proven one of
                    the most monumental system releases of all times. The dual-screen design appealed to all players,
                    ranging from those young, to those casual, and even to those advanced and devoted. As well, the
                    <i>Nintendo DS</i> was fairly affordable. It originally sold for $150, and less than a year after
                    its release, the price dropped to $130, making it even more accessible to the public than it was
                    before.</li>
